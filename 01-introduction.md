Performance attribution is incredibly important in capital markets. It gives investors and portfolio managers valuable insights into the success of their investments and the factors that influence performance. By understanding what drives investment returns, individuals can make well-informed decisions, optimize their portfolio management strategies, and work towards achieving their long-term financial goals.

Lastly, external market conditions, including factors like currency fluctuations, interest rates, and broader 
economic trends, can significantly impact investment performance. By studying the attribution of performance to these 
factors, the article will provide insights into how market conditions shape investment outcomes.
